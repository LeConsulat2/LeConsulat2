👋 Welcome to My GitHub – @LeConsulat2 (Jonathan Park)
About Me

I work at the intersection of operations, project delivery, and data-driven improvement.
My background spans university administration, advisory work, and self-taught software development, where I’ve consistently focused on one thing: making complex work run reliably.

I’m particularly strong at turning messy, real-world operations into structured systems—using clear governance, practical analytics, and lightweight automation to support better decisions and smoother delivery. I’m comfortable bridging technical and non-technical teams, and I value clarity, follow-through, and conscientious execution.

🔍 Core Focus Areas
🧭 Project & Operational Delivery

Supporting work that involves multiple stakeholders, moving priorities, and operational risk

Creating clear reporting, documentation, and delivery rhythm (status, actions, ownership, cadence)

Improving how teams coordinate, not just what tools they use

📊 Data, Analysis & Automation

Practical analytics to surface bottlenecks, trends, and workload pressure

Strong hands-on skills in Excel (Power Query, structured reporting), SQL, and Python

Building small, purpose-driven tools that reduce friction and manual work, rather than over-engineering

🤖 Thoughtful Use of AI

Using AI as a coordination and quality-improvement tool, not a shortcut

Examples include summarisation, structured notes, reporting drafts, and automation support

Always human-checked, privacy-aware, and fit for organisational contexts

🚀 Projects & Collaboration

Open to side projects and collaborations involving analytics, internal tools, or operational optimisation

Experience contributing to Nomad Coders as an English-to-Korean translator for complex programming courses, ensuring technical accuracy and clarity for learners

Particularly interested in projects where technology directly improves how people work

⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve built a deliberately non-linear career—moving from professional golf and golf management, to insurance consulting, and into university operations and advisory work.
That range trained me to stay calm in ambiguity, respect detail, and focus on practical solutions that actually land.
