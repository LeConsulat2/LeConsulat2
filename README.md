# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub – @LeConsulat2 (Jonathan)

## About Me

I work at the intersection of **operations, project delivery, and data-driven improvement**, with experience across university administration, advisory work, and self-taught software development.  
I focus on making complex work run reliably—turning messy, real-world operations into structured systems through clear coordination, practical analytics, and lightweight automation—while confidently bridging technical and non-technical teams.

## 🔍 Interests & Focus Areas

### Operations & Project Delivery
Experienced in supporting work involving multiple stakeholders, shifting priorities, and operational risk, using clear reporting, documentation, and delivery cadence (status, actions, ownership, follow-through) to keep work moving.

### Data, Automation & Analysis
Strong hands-on skills in **Excel (Power Query, structured reporting)**, **SQL**, and **Python**, with a practical approach to analytics that surfaces bottlenecks, workload pressure, and improvement opportunities.

### Thoughtful Use of AI
Interested in leveraging AI as a coordination and quality-improvement tool, including summarisation, structured notes, reporting drafts, and automation support—always human-checked, privacy-aware, and fit for organisational contexts.

## 🚀 Collaboration & Opportunities

- Open to side projects and collaborations in analytics, internal tools, or operational optimisation.
- Proven experience in **English-to-Korean translation** for complex programming courses, having worked on **Nomad Coders’ translation project** to localise technical content accurately and clearly.
- Particularly interested in work where technology directly improves how people work, rather than adding unnecessary complexity.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve built a deliberately non-linear career—from professional golf and golf management to insurance consulting and university operations/advisory work.  
My core strength lies in staying calm in ambiguity, identifying root causes, and delivering step-by-step practical solutions that actually land.
