- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I used to be a profesional golfer, worked in golf courses, hotel resort, insurance, currently working in the unversity. 
                    Now love analytics and slowly getting into programming. 
                    My roles have been the person who works with technical and non-technical users/clients to bridge the gap,
                   I love this end as you get to interact both techincal and non-techincal group of people and fix the issues that appear live.
